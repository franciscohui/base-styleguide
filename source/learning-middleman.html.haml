		%p Using partials to create a separate page to pull in Pinboard links from my feed. This means I can create pages for projects and apps.

		%p Understood basic haml syntax and adding anchor tags. It's all much easier to read now.

		%p Grouping links makes it easier to focus and clear out opened tabs. There's no fear of missing out because it's stored and categorized.

		%p Made the decision to not push my project config file got GitHub. I spent a few hours troubleshooting the s3_sync gem, getting it to use a YAML file to push to AWS. In the end, it was a blocker for not pushing to GitHub and AWS, so I decide to ignore the config file and continue building. Trading no version control for config file for progress on the rest of the site.

		%p Realized that even though Jekyll Bootstrap is probably good for blogging, the number of files and folder structure made it difficult to find a starting point. Watching the Middleman video made it easier to see the contrast and decide to focus on Middleman.
