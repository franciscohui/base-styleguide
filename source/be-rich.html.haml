		Why? Because we love to debate minutiae. When we do, we somehow feel satisfied. We might just be spinning our wheels and failing to change anyone’s mind, but we feel as if we are really expressing ourselves, and it’s a good feeling. We feel like we’re getting somewhere. The problem is that this feeling is totally illusory.

		Focusing on these details is the easiest way to get nothing done. Imagine the last time you and your friend talked about finances or fitness. Did you go for a run afterward? Did you send money to your savings account? Of course not. People love to argue minor points, partially because they feel it absolves them from actually having to do anything.

		The 85 Percent Solution: Getting started is more important than becoming an expert. Too many of us get overwhelmed thinking we need to manage our money perfectly, which leads us to do nothing at all. That’s why the easiest way to manage your money is to take it one step at a time—and not worry about being perfect.

Because he doesn’t care very much about where he lives, but he loves spending money on camping and biking. That’s called conscious spending.

I consider myself rich now that I can do these things: • Make career decisions because I want to, not because of money • Help my parents with their retirement, so they don’t have to work if they don’t want to • Spend extravagantly on the things I love and be relentlessly frugal about the things I don’t (e.g., spend lots on visiting family in New York, but don’t buy the flashiest sports car) • Start a scholarship fund for young entrepreneurs (launched in May 2006!)

		IN WEEK 1, you’ll set up your credit cards and learn how to improve your credit history (and why that’s so important). IN WEEK 2, you’ll set up the right bank accounts, including negotiating to get no-fee, high-interest accounts. IN WEEK 3, you’ll open a 401(k) and an investment account (even if you have just $50 to start). IN WEEK 4, you’ll figure out how much you’re spending. And then you’ll figure out how to make your money go where you want it to go. IN WEEK 5, you’ll automate your new infrastructure to make your accounts play together nicely. IN WEEK 6, you’ll learn why investing isn’t the same as picking stocks—and how you can get the most out of the market with very little work.

		Your credit score can drop more than 100 points, which would add $240/month to an average thirty-year fixed-mortgage loan. 2. Your APR can go up to 30 percent. 3. You’ll be charged a late fee, usually around $35. 4. Your late payment can trigger rate increases on your other credit cards as well, even if you’ve never been late on them.

		Hi, I noticed I missed a payment, and I wanted to confirm that this won’t affect my credit score. CREDIT CARD REP: Let me check on that. No, the late fee will be applied, but it won’t affect your credit score. (Note: If you pay within a few days of your missed bill, it usually won’t be reported to the credit agencies. Call them to be sure.) YOU: Thank you! I’m really happy to hear that. Now, about that fee . . . I understand I was late, but I’d like to have it waived. CREDIT CARD REP: Why? YOU: It was a mistake and it won’t happen again, so I’d like to have the fee removed. (Note: Always end your sentence with strength. Don’t say, “Can you remove this?” Say, “I’d like to have this removed.”) At this point, you have a better-than-50-percent chance of getting the fee credited to your account. But just in case you get an especially tough rep, here’s what to say. CREDIT CARD REP: I’m very sorry, but we can’t refund that fee. I can try to get you our latest blah blah marketing pitch blah blah. . . . YOU: I’m sorry, but I’ve been a customer for four years and I’d hate for this one fee to drive me away from your service. What can you do to remove the late fee? CREDIT CARD REP: Hmm . . . Let me check on that. . . . Yes, I was able to remove the fee this time. It’s been credited to your account.

		If you fall in this category, you should call your credit cards and lenders once per year to ask them what advantages you’re eligible for. Often, they can waive fees, extend credit, and give you private promotions that others don’t have access to. Call them up and use this line: “Hi there. I just checked my credit and noticed that I have a 750 credit score, which is pretty good. I’ve been a customer of yours for the last four years, so I’m wondering what special promotions and offers you have for me . . . I’m thinking of fee waivers and special offers that you use for customer retention.”

Well, a Roth IRA uses after-tax dollars to give you an even better deal. With a Roth, you invest already-taxed income and you don’t pay any tax when you withdraw it.

		aside from the very basics of saving on taxes (like taking advantage of tax-deferred accounts and not selling investments before holding them for a year), chances are you don’t make enough to worry about them.

		THE ONE POT SOLUTION. The solution is simple: Treat all of your accounts as one big pot of money. Instead of trying to hit the proper X/Y/Z allocation in each account, shoot for maintaining that allocation overall.

		tax- inefficient (i.e., income-generating) assets such as bonds should go into a tax-advantaged account like an IRA or 401(k). Conversely, taxable accounts should only hold tax- efficient investments like equity index funds, and you should try to make these accounts static to minimize the tax consequences associated with selling your investments when rebalancing. Finally, since withdrawals from Roth accounts such as a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) will be completely tax free, you should seek to maximize growth in those accounts by picking aggressive investments.

		Invest as much as possible into tax-deferred accounts like your 401(k) and Roth IRA. Because retirement accounts are tax advantaged, you’ll enjoy significant rewards. Your 401(k) money won’t be taxed until you withdraw it many years down the line, and your Roth IRA earnings won’t be taxed at all.

		Sure, you could create complicated tax structures, start putting money away in 529s for your kids, and use the annual gift allowance to give thousands away to others in gifts—but who the hell needs to do that right now? Investing as much as possible in tax-deferred accounts is the answer to 85 percent of your tax questions.

		If you sell an investment that you’ve held for less than a year, you’ll be subject to ordinary income tax, which is usually 25 to 35 percent. Most people who buy a stock and make $10,000 in nine months and stupidly decide to sell it really pocket only $7,500.

		If, however, you hold your investment for more than a year, you’ll pay only a capital-gains tax, which in most cases is currently 15 percent (depending on your income, it could even be less). This is a strong incentive to buy and hold for the long term. In the above example of a $10,000 gain, if you sold it after one year and were taxed at 15 percent, you’d pocket $8,500.

		Bottom line: Invest in retirement accounts and hold your investments for the long term. Until your portfolio swells to roughly $100,000, that’s about all you need to know.

		it’s about freedom—it’s about not having to think about money all the time and being able to travel and work on the things that interest me. It’s about being able to use money to do whatever I want—and not having to worry about my budget, asset allocation, or how I’ll ever be able to afford a house.
